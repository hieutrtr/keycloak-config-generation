# Feature Specification: Advanced Realm Configuration (Draft)

Our goal is to enhance the Keycloak configuration generator so it can handle a complete, production-grade realm setup. The current tool is effective for basic entities, but it needs to support the more detailed and security-critical configurations that administrators use in real-world scenarios. This enhancement will bridge the gap between a basic setup and a fully configured, secure realm, all managed from a single YAML file.

### Deeper Role Management

First, we need to expand how roles are managed. The tool should not just assign roles, but allow for their complete definition within the YAML. This includes creating both realm-level roles and roles specific to a particular client. A key feature to add is support for **composite roles**, which allows an administrator to define a role that inherits permissions from a collection of other roles. This is essential for building clean and maintainable permission models.

### Client Scopes and Token Claims

A major part of configuring clients in Keycloak is managing what claims appear in the tokens. To support this, the tool must be able to define **Client Scopes**. Within these scopes, we need to be able to define **Protocol Mappers**, which are the rules that map user attributes or other data into token claims. Once defined, an administrator should be able to assign these scopes to clients as either default or optional scopes.

### Security and Authentication Policies

To make the generated realms production-ready, we must add key security features. This includes configuring the realm's **brute force detection** policies, such as setting lockout thresholds and wait times. We also need to manage **Required Actions**, which are actions users are forced to take after logging in, like updating a password or configuring two-factor authentication.

Furthermore, the tool should allow setting the default **authentication flow bindings** for the entire realm, specifying which flows are used for browser login, registration, password reset, and other core authentication processes.

### Comprehensive Realm Settings

The current tool only handles a few top-level realm settings. We need to expand this to cover the full spectrum of options available in Keycloak. This includes:

*   **All token lifespan settings**: Covering everything from SSO session timeouts to offline token lifespans and access code validity.
*   **SMTP Server Configuration**: Allowing the administrator to define the realm's email server settings directly in the YAML.
*   **Browser Security Headers**: Providing a way to configure headers like `Content-Security-Policy` to enhance security.
*   **Core Components**: Supporting the `components` block from a Keycloak export, which is used for configuring essential services like **Key Providers** for token signing.
*   **General Attributes**: A simple key-value map for any other miscellaneous realm attributes that need to be set.

By implementing these enhancements, the generator will become a powerful configuration-as-code tool capable of managing the full lifecycle of a complex Keycloak realm.
