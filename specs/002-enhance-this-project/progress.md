# Progress Report: Enhance Realm Configuration

This document tracks the progress made on the "enhance this project with more Realm Configuration" feature.

## Completed Milestones

### 1. Specification & Planning
- **Feature Branch Created**: `002-enhance-this-project`
- **Specification Defined**: A detailed feature specification was created at `specs/002-enhance-this-project/spec.md`. The scope was refined to focus on new realm configurations not covered in the initial CLI implementation.
- **Implementation Plan Created**: A comprehensive plan was generated, resulting in the following artifacts:
    - `plan.md`: The main implementation plan.
    - `research.md`: Research on Keycloak schemas for the new entities.
    - `data-model.md`: Definition of the data structures for the new configurations.
    - `quickstart.md`: A guide for using the new configuration options.

### 2. Task Breakdown
- **Tasks Generated**: The implementation plan was broken down into a detailed list of executable tasks in `specs/002-enhance-this-project/tasks.md`.

### 3. TDD Phase Started
- **Phase 3.1 Complete**: All tasks in the "Tests First (TDD)" phase are now complete.
    - Wrote failing tests for the new data models (`Group`, `UserFederationProvider`, `IdentityProvider`, `AuthenticationFlow`) in `tests/test_models.py`.
    - Updated the integration test in `tests/test_generator.py` to include a failing test case for the enhanced realm configurations.
    - Confirmed that all new tests fail as expected.

### 4. Core Implementation
- **Phase 3.2 Complete**: All tasks in the "Core Implementation" phase are now complete.
    - Implemented the new data models in `src/keycloak_generator/models.py`.
    - Updated the main `Realm` model to include the new configuration sections.
    - Updated the core logic in `src/keycloak_generator/generator.py` to handle the enhanced configuration.
    - Ensured all tests are passing after the implementation.

## Next Steps
The project is now ready to begin the "Polish" phase (Phase 3.3) as outlined in `tasks.md`.
