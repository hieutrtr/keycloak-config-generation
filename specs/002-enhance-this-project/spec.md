# Feature Specification: Enhance Realm Configuration

**Feature Branch**: `002-enhance-this-project`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "enhance this project with more Realm Configuration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Keycloak administrator, I want to define a comprehensive realm configuration in a single YAML file, so that I can easily manage and version control my Keycloak setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a YAML file with group definitions, **When** the generator is run, **Then** the output JSON should contain the corresponding group configurations.
2. **Given** a YAML file with an LDAP user federation provider, **When** the generator is run, **Then** the output JSON should contain the LDAP configuration.
3. **Given** a YAML file with a Google identity provider, **When** the generator is run, **Then** the output JSON should contain the Google IdP configuration.
4. **Given** a YAML file with a custom authentication flow, **When** the generator is run, **Then** the output JSON should define that flow.
5. **Given** a YAML file with token settings (e.g., token lifespan), **When** the generator is run, **Then** the output JSON should reflect those token settings.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the YAML file contains an unknown configuration key?
- How does the system handle invalid or incomplete entity definitions (e.g., a user federation provider with missing URL)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow defining user groups from the input YAML.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow defining user federation providers (e.g., LDAP) from the input YAML.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow defining identity providers (e.g., social logins) from the input YAML.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow defining custom authentication flows from the input YAML.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow defining additional realm settings (e.g., for tokens, security defenses) from the input YAML.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **RealmConfiguration**: Represents the entire set of realm settings.
  - **Groups**: A list of user groups.
  - **UserFederationProviders**: Configuration for external user directories.
  - **IdentityProviders**: Configuration for external identity providers.
  - **AuthenticationFlows**: Definitions for custom login processes.
  - **RealmSettings**: General settings like token lifespan and security defenses.
