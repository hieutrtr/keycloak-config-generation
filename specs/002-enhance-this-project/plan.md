# Implementation Plan: Enhance Realm Configuration

**Branch**: `002-enhance-this-project` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-enhance-this-project/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature enhances the Keycloak configuration generator by adding support for several new realm-level configurations: Groups, User Federation Providers, Identity Providers, Authentication Flows, and expanded Realm Settings. The technical approach is to extend the existing Python data models and generator logic to handle these new entities, maintaining the use of `PyYAML` for parsing and `click` for the CLI.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: `click`, `PyYAML`
**Storage**: N/A (file-based conversion)
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Any platform with Python
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: Small extension to an existing CLI tool

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (the CLI tool)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes
- Libraries listed: `keycloak_generator` (core conversion logic)
- CLI per library: `kc-generate`
- Library docs: `YAML_GUIDE.md` will be updated.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? N/A
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? No (not required for this simple CLI)
- Error context sufficient? Yes, through CLI error messages.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.2.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A for this version.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
Completed. See `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and the empty `contracts` directory.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from the new entities in `data-model.md`.
- Each new entity will get a model creation task and a corresponding failing test task.
- The main `generator.py` will be updated to handle the new entities, with a corresponding integration test update.
- The `YAML_GUIDE.md` will be updated to document the new configuration options.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Models before generator logic.
- Mark [P] for parallel execution for independent model implementation.

**Estimated Output**: ~10-15 new tasks in tasks.md

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A       | N/A        | N/A                                 |
