# Progress Report: Advanced Realm Configuration

This document tracks the progress made on the "Advanced Realm Configuration" feature.

## Completed Milestones

### 1. TDD Phase Started
- **Phase 3.1 Complete**: All tasks in the "Tests First (TDD)" phase are now complete.
    - Wrote failing tests for the new data models (`ClientScope`, `ProtocolMapper`, `RequiredAction`, `IdentityProviderMapper`) in `tests/test_models.py`.
    - Updated the existing tests for `Role` and `IdentityProvider` to include assertions for the new fields related to composite roles and mappers.
    - Created a new, comprehensive integration test in `tests/test_generator.py` to cover all the advanced realm configurations.
    - Confirmed that all new and updated tests fail as expected by running `pytest`.

## Next Steps
The project is now ready to begin the "Core Implementation" phase (Phase 3.2) as outlined in `tasks.md`. The next step is to implement the data models to make the failing unit tests pass.
