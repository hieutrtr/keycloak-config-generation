# Progress Report: Keycloak Config Generation CLI

This document tracks the progress made on the "create a CLI to generate keycloak config" feature.

## Completed Milestones

### 1. Specification & Planning
- **Feature Branch Created**: `001-create-a-cli`
- **Specification Defined**: A detailed feature specification was created at `specs/001-create-a-cli/spec.md`.
- **Implementation Plan Created**: A comprehensive plan was generated, resulting in the following artifacts:
    - `plan.md`: The main implementation plan.
    - `research.md`: Research on Keycloak schemas and Python CLI libraries.
    - `data-model.md`: Definition of the data structures for the configuration.
    - `quickstart.md`: A guide for getting started with the CLI.
    - `contracts/`: Directory for API contracts (currently empty as it's a CLI tool).

### 2. Task Breakdown
- **Tasks Generated**: The implementation plan was broken down into a detailed list of executable tasks in `specs/001-create-a-cli/tasks.md`.

### 3. Project Setup
- **Directory Structure**: Created the source (`src/keycloak_generator`) and test (`tests/`) directories.
- **Dependencies**: Defined project dependencies and metadata in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Virtual Environment**: Set up a virtual environment and successfully installed all project dependencies using Poetry.
- **Version Control**: Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- **Task Tracking**: Updated `tasks.md` to mark the setup phase as complete.

## Next Steps
The project is now ready to begin the "Tests First (TDD)" phase as outlined in `tasks.md`.

### 4. TDD Phase Started
- **T004 Complete**: Wrote the initial failing tests for the `Credential` data model. The tests failed as expected, confirming the test setup is correct.
- **Phase 3.2 Complete**: All tasks in the "Tests First (TDD)" phase are now complete. Failing tests have been created for all data models, the core generator logic, and the CLI. The project is now ready for the implementation phase.
