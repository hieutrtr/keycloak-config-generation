# Feature Specification: Keycloak Config Generation CLI

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-cli`
**Created**: 2025-09-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a CLI to generate keycloak config so i can import into keycloak realm for create or update. keep it simple like a python package. the input will be in yaml for readable and managable that reflect keycloak config that in json. and a comprehensive guideline so i can use as context to ask AI generate me the yaml input."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to define Keycloak realm configurations in a human-readable YAML file, so that I can easily manage and version-control them. I want to use a CLI tool to convert this YAML file into the JSON format that Keycloak requires for realm imports.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid YAML file containing Keycloak realm configuration, **When** I run the CLI with the path to the YAML file, **Then** the tool generates a corresponding JSON file.
2. **Given** a YAML file with incorrect syntax, **When** I run the CLI, **Then** it reports a clear error message and does not generate a JSON file.
3. **Given** I ask for help, **When** I run the CLI with a `--help` flag, **Then** it displays usage instructions.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the input YAML is valid but contains logically incorrect Keycloak configuration? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the tool perform validation against Keycloak's schema?]
- How does the system handle very large configuration files? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there performance or memory constraints to consider?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a command-line interface (CLI).
- **FR-002**: The CLI MUST accept a path to a YAML file as input.
- **FR-003**: The CLI MUST generate a JSON file as output.
- **FR-004**: The generated JSON MUST be a valid Keycloak realm configuration format.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a comprehensive guideline on the YAML structure. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What format should this guideline be in? (e.g., Markdown, hosted documentation)]
- **FR-006**: The CLI MUST be packaged and distributed as a Python package.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Keycloak Configuration (YAML)**: A human-readable representation of a Keycloak realm. It includes clients, roles, users, and other realm settings.
- **Keycloak Configuration (JSON)**: The machine-readable Keycloak realm representation, generated from the YAML input.
